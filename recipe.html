        Kottu is made up of paratha or wheat flour roti, 
        which is cut into small pieces or ribbons.Then on a heated iron sheet or griddle,
        vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat,
        or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally,
        the pieces of cut paratha are added.
        These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula,
        the sound of which is very distinctive and can usually be heard from a long distance.
        Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable,
        egg, chicken, beef, mutton, and fish kottu roti.
        It is often prepared and served as a fast food dish.
